# Consumer Behaviour in the Mall: Cluster Analysis 
- Comparing Liverpool's last 10 years of performances with transfer spending each season --> there is evidence to suggest more spending leads to fewer matches been lost but there is no concrete evidence to suggest more spending leads to winning more matches.
- Built a dashboard for Liverpool's performance in the last decade on Streamlit platform which is free and easy to share with stakeholders.
- Optimized K-Means and Hierarchical clustering methods to reach the conclusion of the analysis.
- Built a client facing API and Heroku to view the dashboard on [Streamlit](https://liverpooldashboard.herokuapp.com/).
